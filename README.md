### Hi there, I'm Evandro Pomatti ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software architect leading enterprise projects around the globe. This is the place I hide to get some personal code done and contribute when I can.

Long time [Architect Elevator](https://architectelevator.com/) rider ðŸ¦• I'm interested in building well-architected applications alongside great development teams.

Outside tech I'm a casual rock singer and skydiver ðŸª‚
